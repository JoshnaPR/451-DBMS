## What's New
* Adding Sales Report
* Table Booking System

## Work Summary
In this sprint, we worked module 2 of the Meta Database Engineering Capstone Project on coursera. In module 2, we were required to complete the adding sales report and table booking system features. For each of these features, there were multiple tasks. Adding sales report consists of the following tasks: create virtual table OrderView, extract customer who spent a certain amount, view menu items, create stored procedure called GetMaxQuantity, CancelOrder, and create prepared statement called GetOrderDetail. The table booking systems consists of the following tasks: populate bookings table, create procedures for CheckBooking, AddValidBooking, AddBooking, UpdateBooking, and CancelBooking. The expected outcome for this sprint is to create virtual table, stored procedures, and prepared statements to query the database.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Completed Module 2 of the Course Era Project
* Completed initial steps of creating the database, tables, and inserting the necessary values
* Tracked all github issues using our Kanban Board

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Find a way to query more efficiently

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Module 3 of Coursera (Data visualization & Database Client)
